# Questioner
Motivating question asking script

Very simple scripts. It reads questions.txt line by line and than you answer. Saves data in ./Storage/*YEAR*/*MONTH*/*DAY*.txt 

Also motivates you with lines from wisdoms.txt.

Do it daily!

P.S. Tried it only on Windows. Contains copyed code from SO.
